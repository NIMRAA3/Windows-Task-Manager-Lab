# Windows Task Manager Lab Report

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This repository contains a lab report on **Windows Task Manager**, demonstrating its use in managing processes, monitoring services, and analyzing system performance. Task Manager serves as a first-line diagnostic tool for troubleshooting and maintaining system stability.

## ðŸ”¹ Objectives
- Explore processes, services, and performance monitoring in Task Manager.  
- Understand memory usage, network activity, and process categories.  
- Use Task Manager for troubleshooting and system analysis.  

## ðŸ”¹ Lab Tasks & Findings
### Part 1: Processes Tab
- Observed processes categorized as Apps, Background, and Windows Processes.  
- Verified `conhost.exe` location in `C:\Windows\System32`.  
- Closed processes and observed effects (e.g., ending Edge closed all browser windows).  
- Sorted processes by memory usage and switched to percentage view.  
- Tested double-click and end task functions.  

### Part 2: Services Tab
- Identified service states: **Running** or **Stopped**.  

### Part 3: Performance Tab
- Threads running: 2594 | Processes running: 222  
- Physical Memory: 8.0 GB DDR3 | Available: 3.4 GB | In Use: 4.4 GB  
- Ethernet Link Speed: 1.0 Gbps | IPv4 Address: 192.168.56.1  
- Opened **Resource Monitor** for deeper performance insights.  

## ðŸ”¹ Reflection
Task Manager is essential for administrators because it enables:  
- Monitoring CPU, memory, disk, and network usage.  
- Identifying unresponsive apps, malware, or high resource usage.  
- Managing processes and services.  
- Troubleshooting freezes, crashes, and slowdowns.  
- Monitoring active users and sessions.  

## ðŸ”¹ Learning Outcomes
- Navigated and utilized different Task Manager tabs.  
- Monitored processes, services, and system performance in real-time.  
- Gained experience in troubleshooting using Task Manager and Resource Monitor.  
- Understood the significance of memory usage for system stability.  
- Strengthened diagnostic and system management skills.
